# OpenTelemetry Demo for .NET Applications

This repository demonstrates the integration of OpenTelemetry in .NET applications, showcasing how to implement observability through tracing, metrics, and logging.

## Overview

OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework that provides APIs, libraries, agents, and instrumentation to enable the collection of distributed traces and metrics from applications. This demo illustrates how to instrument a .NET application using OpenTelemetry to monitor and analyze its behavior.

## Features

- **Tracing**: Capture and visualize the flow of requests through the application.
- **Metrics**: Collect numerical measurements such as request counts and durations.
- **Logging**: Record application logs with contextual information.

## Visualizing telemetry

To visualize the telemetry data, use the [Observability Stack](https://github.com/danielvieiravega/observability-stack)

## Running the Application
Locally
1. Run the application:
```bash
dotnet run
```
2. Access the application:

Navigate to http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.
